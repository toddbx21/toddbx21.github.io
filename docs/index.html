        <h3>A Brief Biography of My Life</h3>
        <body>
          I was born in Delaware, but moved to a nearby town in Pennsylvania at a very young age. </br>
          Despite my curiosity for the world around me and the passion to know 'why?',</br>
          it took me a while to fully understand that I need to learn to be satisfied. </br>
          I went through high school and had, what I imagine at 21 years old, to be the full scope of</br>
          what could be considered 'ups and downs'. That did not stop me getting into Juniata College where </br>
          my passion for education reached its peak, following the curriculum to be a biology secondary education teacher. </br>
          In my senior year of college, I no longer have education as my major (or as Juniata College refers to it, POE),</br>
          citing grievences in a multitude of common problems in the education system,</br>
          I focus now in the research side of Biology.</br>
        </body>
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for learning and education has not stopped as shown in my work in the Instructional Design Team.</br>
        My strength in technology has grown and I love to apply my learning to teaching others.</br>
      </p>
      <p>
      <h3>My Personal Statement</h3>
        <body>
          I would like to find the best possible way to <b>inspire</b> learning to as many people as I can.<br/>
          It is ok to teach information to students and expect that it is enough for those students.</br>
          Students can find almost any information they need without a teacher, so it is the job of the teacher to </br>
          cultivate a healthy social environment and encourage a willingness to learn, with respect and communication</br>
          with the peers a student shares an environment with.

        <h3>Academic Interests</h3>
        <body>
          My POE (Program of Emphasis), or Major, is Biology with a Secondary Emphasis (Minor) in Education.</br>
        </body>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Programming Interests</h3>
        <body>
          My programming interests center around, not education, but the will to get my voice into the world.</br>
          I feel like I am still learning. While I do not have many lessons to share, I think it is important to</br>
          document my thought process and rationale from the experiences and lessons that I am currently learning.</br>
          Programming will help me do this because, at the very least, it will give me new experiences to share.</br>
          At the best, I get to learn new ways to share my experiences as well. It is a wide and expanding world of technology,</br>
          I am excited to be a part of learning it.

        <h3>Research Interests</h3>
        <body>
          My main area of interest in biology research is with the plasticity of diapause in the Fall Field and Sand Field Cricket.</br>
          In simpler terms, the question I would like to answer is as follows:</br>
          Is the time of pause in development within the two cricket species able to be changed with the environment,</br>
          or is there something within the genome of the crickets that sets an amount of time that the pause in development must have?</br>
          A broader impact that can come from this research is directly related to climate change.</br>
          If the environment influences the two species development rates into hatching from the eggs,</br>
          then contemporary golbal climate change may cause a problem with ecological structures with the same or similar crickets as a primary consumer.
